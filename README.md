# üíª ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin Docker Image

 This repository hosts an automated build system for creating üê≥ Docker images of the [ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin), a ChatGPT plugin by OpenAI. The built Docker images are also hosted in this repository for easy access and usage.

## üìñ Overview

The build system automates the process of pulling the latest code from the main branch of the ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin project, packaging it into a Docker image, and publishing the image. The images are optimized for different vector database providers, resulting in improved performance and reduced image size.

‚ö°Ô∏è **New**: We now have a Helm chart available for deploying the ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin! Check it out [here](https://github.com/icoretech/helm) for easy deployment and management of the plugin.

## üöÄ Supported Vector Database Providers

The build system creates optimized images for the following vector database providers:

## üí° Usage

The idea is to use these images as a base to further customize your running instances.

To pull a Docker image, use the following command:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/icoretech/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin-docker:<tag>
```

Replace `<tag>` with the specific version you wish to pull.
To choose an image optimized for a particular vector database provider, use the provider's name as the tag.

For example, to pull the Pinecone optimized image, use `pinecone-<commit_sha>-<timestamp>` as the tag.

You can find the available tags on the [GitHub Packages page](https://github.com/icoretech/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin-docker/pkgs/container/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin-docker) for this repository.

While it is possible to run images as-is without customization, it is strongly recommended to do so in environments where you can properly configure and manage the runtime, such as Helm or Docker Compose setups or if you are an implementator.
